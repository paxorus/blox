var texts="I don't think you're a stalker@No, my parents are depositing money in her account.@\"Yo Shawn gimme ur account # Pls\"@The thing with the cash.@You know I try to avoid conflict@My first instinct is to tell you that you could have misinterpreted something I said, or that I might not have communicated clearly with you and I'm sorry for that.@But no. You hallucinated the \"she wants cash\" thing.@I see. But I try to avoid strong statements in volatile environments.@Mostly I'm thinking about you and Joseph together.@I forget that sometimes you take things pretty close to heart.@So I try not to say anything too drastic@But I still want to convey displeasure.@Don't crush on buttheads.@God, you are so good at sounding unintentionally stalkerish@Have you ever seen the movie Fargo@Because that movie. I saw it this weekend.@Two words: Triple homicide.@What else do you need?@It was a wonderful movie.@Not just three dead people.@Way more than three die@But the police get called out for this intense ass crime scene.@They never do, Prakhar.@Set your standards low and you'll never be disappointed.@That's how it goes.@It just dawned on me@How 'bout the FBI@Justice is always looking for new recruits.@They handle federal crimes.@Like bank robberies and kidnappings and crimes that occur across state lines.@I think hitchhikers guide to the galaxy basically sums up my philosophy on ineffective government.@\"Anyone capable of getting themselves made president should on no account be allowed to do the job\"@But the problem is they do.@The best we can do as fellow humans is try to water down the corruption and incompetence with genuineness, hard-work and compassion.@Yeah I got that. Maybe I'll have Siri call me something else.@Indeed. And that's often the best solution, but it doesn't last@Hopefully they'll learn to do mine shortly after@I don't believe in hiding things from kids. But I learned the craziest stuff in fairytale class@I'm sorry I said that. Anyway, apparently the violence of fairytales is supposed to be a way of introducing children to the harsh realities of the world, while offsetting them with optimism and manic.@And now I get why I was never into fairytales as a kid. I just skipped right to learning about the violent real world really early on.@Like, little red riding hood is supposed to be a \"stranger danger\" thing. Except in kindergarten when a policeman came in and asked all the kids if they would go with a stranger if he offered them candy/money/he said he needed help I was the only one who said no@But now maybe I've got trust issues and am suspicious of everyone.@It's a give and take kind of situation.@I don't like people.@No one in my family likes people.@But I don't trust people in general.@But you trust too many people.@You're gonna get yourself in trouble.@What is there to like?@Seriously. What is there to like?@Actually though. I don't know@I just don't. My mom doesn't either.@I guess it's just that we're both really family/friend oriented.@It's too hard to worry about everyone.@Compassionate but removed. It might just be our personalities.@Great for law enforcement. Terrible for everything else.@It's more complicated than that@People are hard to get along with. There are a few people I connect with and I dunno. Why do I need more?@Is the girl your sister, mother or myself?@Then it's pretty bad@Why do you ask@Would you say to a woman: \"I've thought about thinking about having sex with you. I think it's very reasonable that I thought about thought about having sex with you. I've got no problem sharing this with you, because I see no reason to think the idea would make you uncomfortable. Anyway, I thought about thinking about it, but you are for some reason disgusting, and I see no problem with telling you that. You're repulsive. Have a nice day\"@Tell Jeremy what I said. I'm reading your stuff now.@It's okay to think gay sex is gross.@You just have to acknowledge that the people who do it arent gross, messed up, mentally ill, inherently sinful or less deserving of rights than people who have straight sex or no sex at all.@But honestly like every straight guy on the planet gets squeamish thinking about two guys fucking.@But basically you can respectfully decide to not want to think about two guys getting it on.@You can read whatever part you want.@Alex thinks it's fishy that gay people make more money@Dude gay people don't inadvertently make babies. In fact, they don't make babies at all, so they have to go get one. And they can't do that til they're good and ready and able to support said babies. Therefore, they have more money to spend on themselves.@Kids. They're expensive little shits.@Okay well say there wasn't.@Doesn't the idea expressed that way seem extremely inappropriate?@Why does Alex think it's fishy that gay people are from wealthy places@My answer was a gross oversimplification and probably outright wrong.@I mean, I guess it is, if your idea of privilege is not being responsible for propagating the human race.@But no one needs to do that. Ask Devon.@I know. I was kidding.@But homosexuality isn't a choice? Why would someone so into neuroscience think it is@I only have the vaguest understanding of the subject, but even I know enough to know that neurological differences have been found between straight guys and gay guys.@But I mean, I don't pretend to understand neuroscience. But I try to be relatively well rounded and educated, and a lot of people who do understand neuroscience have said there's a difference.@That's how society works.@When someone thinks they understand something better than all the smarties who took it upon themselves to spend their lives understandings this stuff, it's not good.@I mean when laypeople make decisions based on their own reinvention of science.@It's good to question and research and be skeptical and stuff. And I'm not advocating blind trust.@But that level of reinventing science to fit ones needs is usually reserved for anti-vax'ers and congressmen.@Anyway maybe I'm not phrasing this correctly.@What I'm trying to say is that there are three types of people you should never take medical advice from: anti-vaxers, Congresspeople, and Alex Mitchell.@Yes! Like pizza and cheese.@And if you count cylinders, cannoli@Oh lord. Cannoli. I got an amaretto cannoli two days ago and it was the best thing that's happening all week.@The bread went stale so I made them on English muffins and ate them@I cannot.

You can't fly off the deep end every time someone pisses you off.@But you said you liked spending points on people@I'm not letting you not be friends with anyone else.@And please please please please for the love of all that's unholy, act civil with Joseph.@I'm not saying marry him. I'm saying don't ignore him when he tries to talk to you.@Please. He's complaining to me that you're making it impossible to work on the project@And I'm not mad that he's complaining. And dont get mad at him for complaining to me.@Then we can all be at peace and it'll be wonderful and life can be void of middle schoolesque stress.@Just act civil. I promise, it feels so good to not be at war with anyone.@You'll be happy. You'll meet with friends.@I mean okay but just@Look, just promise if something was wrong, you'd tell me, and that won't resent me for something I didn't know I was doing.@Yoseph said you guys came to some kind of agreement@Oh. That's a good decision.@Hey, when are you getting dinner@Okay well my computer died and I'm on my phone.@But I'll take your word for it@When are you headed to Sherman@Oh. I wasn't asking@I'm full.

Where have you been eating?@Like upper and stuff?@Have you not been eating at all@It doesn't. Why aren't you eating@You can't just not be hungry for day@You did that on purpose@Stop making yourself sound pathetic@I'll see you then@Aren't we all alone@Yes, I am. Wanna meet somewhere?@And it give me that@I have voted for myself.@I did not plan on getting dinner tonight. I was going to make some rice and beans.@It's just 90 meals over the whole semester. It's bad though. I think I've used like half.@I'm not crazy about Sherman, but I like their chicken and cereal.@I mean that's just an objective fact@Where are you eating@Ah. I ate it.@It was a bad idea.@We'll get a different flavor next time@I got stomach aches like whatever.@It tasted like heaven.@Ah I have a thing tomorrow.@And yes the book is for tomorrow@I'm meeting the the other future editor@People call him Moon-moon, but he prefers David, so I call him David.@A lot of people do. I don't think he cares that much.@Anything in between. Not particularly picky.@I doubt I will, Prakhar.

I'll let it go.@When I tell you I'm going to bed I mean it@It's sincere at the time@No, you misunderstood me@I told you I was going to bed like four times tonight@When I say it, I intended to go to bed. It just winds up not happening@Nope. Did Alex read the bible@I'm curious if Jeremy has fallen in Alex's esteem now@What did he say@\"don't have sex, god said so\"@Oh points for him@Yeah, I got that. Why'd you call Natsuko?@I just really want to know how you try to convince someone not to have sex@As a humanities person, particularly as a legal studies student, I'm fascinated by how one would formulate that argument.@What wasn't worth what?@Okay, yeah. I should have said \"penetration isn't worth what\"@I also like how he threw in a dig about getting farther than Jeremy@I also don't really understand why penetrations like, so much different@I mean do people do other racy naked things and then stop like \"oh it doesn't count\"@I think I might do it over Facebook@I'm glad Jeremy didn't take any of that crap though@That \"I got farther than you but still backed out\" though.@Do you see how brilliant that is?@He is bragging about his sexual prowess and his piety at the same time.@But yeah, behind the back@Oh boy I gotta ask.@Something like \"From a strictly professional curiosity, how exactly does one formulate argument against getting it on?\"@am I bad person?@I can be subtle@And it's not a priority@Well, I don't, so you're gonna have to go by yourself.@Yes. Both sides of a postcard. So thoughtful of you to plan to send me one@Okay. Don't hurry back.@This time. This time I am going to bed@A little before ten@Are you here? Because I moved@Don't rush. I'm in the library where Starbucks is@Because it's crowded and I'm in a bad mood@Child murders, and also Sodexo.@I'm getting crazy hungry.@I just wanted to tell you that as soon as you left dinner tonight Margaret and Missy asked me what got you so down.@They were worried, because you hadn't been speaking to them, and they heard you had a falling out with someone, and they hoped you were alright.@Yeah okay well you can have your pityfest when I'm done. @Then I asked if you'd been annoying them lately.@And they said no, right away.@Then they said the conversation they had with you over facebook was \"the most fun thing they've done in like forever\"@And told me how they thought your posts in the Stein party \"were really entertaining\" and that they wished they'd been able to go to a Stein party, but Margaret wasn't eating the food there because it was Lent.@And that they both \"wanted to hang out there soon\"@So here you are, with lotsa people who worry and care about you, and you're being a total downer.@I'm not saying you need to invite everyone to the Stein party. I'm just saying I don't know why you act miserable and dinner and don't eat a lot and say you don't want to hang out with Michael on his birthday and are just... I dunno. Sad.@So don't mope? I'm confused. Are you depressed?@Maybe you should see a head doctor.@What does the \"they don't take attitude\" thing mean?@And then what happened?@I don't understand. Why did it make you feel good thinking about making someone else's life harder? Someone you don't know, by the way, and opted to judge solely on their profession?@I guess that doesn't matter. Just, there's no reason to sit around and suffer and be miserable. If you need help you should get it.@I won't bother you about it anymore then.@What was he apologizing for?@How long you gonna be there?@Can I join you guys in a bite@Or are you leaving soon?@No, because I need to accomplish things and if you come here Ill never work@I thought it was like, 12:30 tops last night. And it was 2am. Like, no.@No what I mean is@If I went there I wouldn't stay long.@I see. I sort of thought the nonanswer meant don't come@You asked me what I had to do@And didn't respond, which I thought meant \"like oh, you must be busy, I'll leave you to it then\"@Honestly. What is there to say about Devon that he won't say about himself@Hey I can't get in though@If you aren't clear what side of the line the joke is on, you probably shouldn't make it.@Why did Alex tell you your potentially dead grandparents were rich@No, I don't think so@Will Michael be offended if I don't?@Fair enough, I guess@Do you have ice cream?@It's late, and I'm not fed to stay up late@Seriously. Fucking. Nothing. Was. Open.@When do you plan on waking up tomorrow?@I was lazy. And busy helping people@I didn't post anything@Well Sherman opens at 9:30. Care to breakfast?@You said you planned on waking up anyway?@Don't get up early on my account@Oh then yes, go to bed@Have you been waiting@Oh no okay if you still wanna eat I can come@I can't tell if you're being serious@I'm going to Sherman@But I'm not staying for hours@It's more like too decisive, and than not@Why does it matter?@Wasn't that a few nights ago?@No reason. I think I went back and corrected myself though@I didn't correct myself. I'm sorry.@I did find your notebook@As for the project- it's not@Well, good luck with that@What were you thinking for the anth class? They all look kinda lame@I mean, I dunno@You've taken 1a though, yeah?@Take the Warren Court class with me@We can fangirl over the Supreme Court together@And the Warren Court@Anyway, I'm kidding. Wanna take Anth 1a?@The professor looked lame@Well, I didn't pay attention to how he looked@I mean there was a guy teaching Anth1 this semester when I signed up, and he really babied the course@Now there are like 7 classes I want to take@I started with 0@But now there are a lot.@Administrative Law is in session, you know, in a cosmic sense@It's just that before break he spoke to these two kids like \"hey you were in my Con Law class last semester, whats the answer\"@And they didn't know. And I was sitting there like bitch I went to the class almost everyday and I know the answer goddammit and you don't even recognize me@I never pretended I wasn't a fool@I love that sticker@If flowers just sit outside and be bums, the I guess yes@Who is the genius behind that quote?@True. Are you taking any classes this summer?@I need to do some reading for my next class, so I'll talk to you later, ait?@IM SORRY I HAD A MEETING@And I was like oh shit I should tell Prakhar@But then I didn't, because I'm an idiot@Not sure. It's not so much that I need credits as it is I need something to do and people to interact with.@I do but not like, academically@I could. I could lie.@Because I think umma head over to the library soon@In like 30 min?@Usdan doesn't open til 8@No, I just got up@But I was gonna get ready and stuff. And then go to Usdan a little after 8@Okay. Go back to sleep@Oh. Thanks. I guess it's just like, you don't HAVE to say anything@I don't expect you to@Oh. Like about my earrings and stuff@Sorry sorry I was unclear. So what about Joseph?@But what do myself and Varges doubt about Joseph?@You don't need to handle me@What was your angle exactly?@But if you could just keep it to one comment@Like, either the earrings, or the eyeliner.@That's true. Maybe I'm just edgy because I know Josephs usually being a dick when he asks about that stuff. Although when I made the comment \"it was hot out, I figured I'd wear earrings\" I could tell you were waiting for a like girl-logic explanation.@That was funny. And thank you. But Yoseph's bloodletting thing. He was baiting you, wasn't he?@Prakhar, you just gotta let it go@The stuff that Joseph does to bait you.@Just act like it doesn't bother you. You get soooooo worked up and he loves it.@But I don't get it@Oh great. What was it@Oh for fucks sake@He can't translate that into acting like a doof@He needs to act like an adult@Prakhar, he's your filthy little attention slut and he loves it.@And if you're okay with that, far be it from me to judge the relationships you have with other people. But it's draining to have someone like that, and you might not be helping Joseph in the long run if you don't force him to sort out his feelings like an adult@And that's his problem.@Well, I guess I should say it shouldn't be your problem.@You don't owe him that. And are you going to indulge this behavior his whole life?@Christ, I sound like I'm telling you how to parent your child. I'll stop. Sorry.@I appreciate that. My opinion is that you're indulging him and burdening yourself. It's emotionally draining to deal with, and he can't act out like a little kid to get someone's attention his whole life. Don't feel like you have to put up with him. You don't.@I'm just concerned for you. I'm glad you listen at least. Joseph is asking too much of you. Whether you want to give it or not is your prerogative, but I'm telling you as a semi-objective observer he's asking too much.@Just don't feel like you need to force it all out.@I know. It's just...It's like, you can't be his emotional enema forever. At some point he's just going to have to realize he's not getting enough fiber in his diet and deal with his shit the way everyone else does. Eat some broccoli or something.@I do respect how much you want to help your friends though.@Ha. It's alright. Dat analogy though.@Anyway, yes, help your people's@Okay. Or you could just say \"alright. Good night! I hope you feel better\"@There comes a point where you need to not make his life your responsibility@You shouldn't have to ask him to let you help him. He should ask you.@You can't ever help someone who isn't willing to help themselves. So long as he isn't, you're only stressing yourself out.@I know you'll bend over backwards to help a friend, and I really appreciate that.@It's an amazing part of who you are. But you need to not push yourself so far.@Sure, whatever. Library party sometime this week@It's not worth it@How have you been acting?@The tension, him acting up. It's not worth it. If he starts acting like a little bitch I'll just ignore him.@No I mean if he wants to hang out, sure.@I just don't trust him. Oh well. I didn't realize it was causing such a problem for you@But you feel the need to take care of him, and that's your prerogative, and I don't care if he hangs out with us.@We were close friends. Then he started using me and hurting me without any thought to how I felt.@So it was stressful and sad. Now I know I can't trust him. So what do I care what he thinks and says about me?@Prakhar I'm not his friend. That doesn't mean I can't be civil.@My opinion of Joseph is that he isn't worth any of my energy at all. If it's easier to avoid him, whatever. If it's easier for him to join us at the library, whatever.@I swear to god@Prakhar are you listening to anything I say@I've told you over and over@I don't trust him. The possibility for a friendship is shot even if I wanted it. But I can be civil. Who cares?@Let me emphasis again: not me@Prakhar, remember when I said friendship was about being honest with each other, and that if we had a problem with something someone else was doing, we should say something instead of letting it stew up silently@I'm being honest. I don't like expecting my friends to read into something I say. I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. If avoiding me is distressing or bothersome for either of you, then don't bother@I meant me avoiding Joseph or you getting Joseph to avoid me@I'm not like 100% articulate.@But that's just more work for you@You're making Catherine uncomfortable@I will. It is a little too late, and also did this morning actually happen@I guess it did@Not that that's indicative of any time I usually get up.@I wake up anytime between 6am and 3pm, because I make bad decisions sometimes and have no control over my life@About an hour ago I got curritos.@Then I thought it was really nice out so I ate it outside and then wandered around aimlessly.@Then I got some juice and now I'm back in my room. My headache has not subsided.@Oh my god that's half of the Devils number.@Are you an agent of satan@I'm pretty done, yeah.@Mostly because of this headache.@No, I'm good. Thanks though, Satan.@Sherman, probably. Usdan I think doesn't open til 11@I hate those guys and their poetry.@I know you're all better than this.@I like the library@Since we set a time and never actually wind up@I meant 10am tentatively, because we never wind up keeping the times we set@I will message you before I head to Sherman or you should message me before you go@But sometime around ten.@I'll be at Sherman around that time also@Because my phones gonna die like now and I'm going to go in@If I don't hear from you.@N/m it's fine, but you should hurry. There are like two seats left@if I recall, there are fans in your room@Whatever. I spoke to him. He was annoying.@You had other people.@I thought he was worth some attention.@I was wrong. He was annoying@I started talking about superheroes and he somehow started complaining about how they were all privileged and had their powers handed to them and were rich.@And how the Justice League was elitist. I tried to explain why comics were more complicated than that and tried to come up with heroes who didn't fit that mold and how Stan Lee did this stuff and also how the Justice League is criticized in the DC universe as being elitist and he wasn't having it.@He just wanted to say annoying, controversial things. It was annoying.@I had breakfast with you.@I wasn't doing you a favor.@It is. But I'd rather Alex not be convinced I hate him@I don't hate him. It doesn't seem worth the energy to hate him.@Prakhar jeez. it's not like that.@Like, meeting for breakfast is great. I just can't meet up more than once a day@You're never, ever, ever sleeping in my room@Well, that's not true. If you were dying or something and need to sleep somewhere you could sleep in my room. But I wouldn't sleep there also.@If my affectionate insults ever get too much let me know too@I think of you like the brother I'm going to have to pick up at jail one day@\"I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed\"@I hate it when people do that to me@Oh I didn't see a lot of those messages@Yeah I've been having fun@Also oh my god I'm fat@I mean you're not but@Hey. I'm on my way back to Brandeis now but I might be late. It's supposed to get in exactly at 5 so can you cover for me for like five minutes@I'm just doing clean up, yeah? So who cares@I un-lost myself in Boston today and I was so proud.@I'm proud of me to@My fingers are a little numb. My typing might suck@\"That's not good to know, sister\"@Yeah. Well, I'll see you soon@Okay n/m that was faster than I thought. Where is the clean up thing@Since that's where the events were@in a cosmic sense@more because I have to than that I'm capable of it@Don't worry about me@Well don't feel like you need to be there because I might come@I'll be over soon@Oh but not me@Just my life story@Do you need it tonight@Because imma see you tomorrow morning@I mean to say \"what? why?\"@but whay works too@why, what'd they say?@From Joseph, but my phone was on silent because its 12:15 and fuck people@I mean I was talking to you anyway but now that Jeremy said I should@I'm sure you understand@I was mostly kidding@I'm on my way@Are we just gonna meet there@Are you meeting them there?@What's the ticket booth?@yeah that's where I am@As in, I'm leaning on it as we speak. Where are you@Sometimes they break, because they're made out of cheap plastic.@And they recorded it and want to go to campus police?@Why? What the hell did you say@Id like to point out that truth is an absolute defense in slander cases.@Also, I'd like to point out that truth is an absolute defense in slander cases.@Hey Prakhar, did you know it isn't slander if it's true?@I bet you do@Did my name come up?@God though such drama queens@Prakhar, you're weird and worry about other people too much.@I'm trying to think about what I've said about you behind your back.@I just remember Margaret and Missy asked what was up when they were worried and I said you were weird sometimes and worry about other people.@I insult my friends to their faces.@Did you ask him what I allegedly said about you@There were dozens of ants.@Yoseph used it with me, I know.@It's the worst feeling in the world. I have zero respect for anyone who would do that.@Just, what was the gist?@Talk about leading questions.@It sounds like a deposition.@\"Why were you trying to sabotage my relationships\"@\"Why did you slander me\"@Defamation is against the law. Gossip is generally frowned upon in polite settings. They're acting like privileged idiots who think it's a crime to have their actions come back to haunt them.@What the hell did you and Yoseph talk about for 10 hours@I hope my name didn't come up?@I'm sorry that's my reaction to everything@I guess that's kind of egotistical of me.@Oh great. What did you say@Well thank you for not speaking on my behalf.@So I suppose he still thinks I'm an academically unimpressive delusional bitch@So he hates me@You're not wrong. Is he okay@Okay. I hate to cut you off but I'm in Usdan and my phones gonna die in like 2 minutes@I'm sorry. I'll talk to you later.@Why do you do this to me@I tell people things all the timer@Like, \"you should read that\" or \"we should watch that\"@And then you actually do.@And what do I say@It's like, please don't doing something enjoyable on my account. You should do something enjoyable. But not because I suggested it.@I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS POWER.@Do them because you think you'll enjoy them@Well good because it's awesome@But not because I say it is.@Prakhar what are you doing I can't cope with this.@Maybe I should just go stick my head in a bucket of water@\"I had an argument with Prakhar today with Alex\"@\"You had an argument with Prakhar about Prakhar\"@\"And how did that go\"@\"Good I think. Can you keep an eye on him? I think he's depressed\"@\"I thought he was feeling better\"@\"No, I don't think so\"@\"Um okay Jeremy. You're probably right.
